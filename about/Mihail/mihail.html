        <h1>Mihail Karagyozov</h1>
        <img src  = "me.jpg" class = "me">
        <p>My full name is Mihail Nikolaev Karagyozov I am the lead Designer at Halfling Housing. I was responsible for most hi-fi's, mood boards and styleguides when it comes to our project "Halfling Housing"</p>
        <img src ="progress1.png" class = "progress">
        <p>I started out with figuring out what we should use as basic colors, a color palette, because we had to be able to work on our own, so we had to agree on colors,<br> so that there isnt any conflict when putting together the site at the end.</br>After completing all the hi-fi's for the main page, I met up with one of our stakeholders - a fellow student in Groningen,<br> interested in our information about the tiny houses, he told me there is too much elements on the front page<br> and so I decided to remove the originally included kid, and replaced it with buttons on top (pictures before and after below).<br>That made the site more friendly towards necoming users, and easier to navigate, overall bettering the UI,<br> and the person I was communnicating with confirmed that he preffered the new version better.</p>

        <p>Hopefully with this, you now have a better understanding of my job and if you ever need me for a project, you can contact me about it. Enjoy our website!</p>
