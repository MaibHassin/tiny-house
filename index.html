      <p id="introDescription">The term Tiny House means a lot of things to a lot of different people, there are many interpretations possible. The Tiny House movement is all about the philosophy: <span id="introDescriptionPost">Being content with having enough and creating a life brought back to the essence, of that what is important. How much space do you need to live happily without ballast? It is different for each of us.  How can you create a living situation that is as healthy, environmentally friendly and free as it can be, in a way that matches with your personality? By living in a Tiny House, you create room in your life for building relationships, spent time in nature, focus on having experiences. A Tiny House is not so much the goal as it is the means to create the life you want to live.</span></p>

        <img src="images/historyHeading.svg" alt="a tiny bit of history svg text">
        <p id="historyTextF">The Tiny House ‘movement’ as we know it originated in the United States, as an answer to a series of events that shook the housing market. A collapsing economy and disasters like hurricane Katrina caused people to lose their homes and young people found it increasingly difficult to obtain a house. As the need for affordable and flexible housing grew, some people started building their own little houses. Jay Shafer and Dee Williams among others, became pioneers in the Tiny House movement.</p>
        <p id="historyTextS">To bypass limiting regulations that dictate minimum measurements of dwelling units, these pioneers build their home on a trailer, thus starting an interesting movement with a beautiful philosophy: the Tiny House movement. These days the popularity of Tiny Houses has grown to sizable numbers. You can find hundreds of books, blogs, television series like Tiny House Nation. Around 40.000 people visited the first Tiny House Jamboree in 2015. As is often the case, the rest of the world is following and now also in Europe builders and enthusiasts are popping up everywhere.</p>

            <h3 class="typeInfoHead">Cob Houses</h3>
            <p>The idea of a home may seem intimidating to some, but cob houses are much more than a small clay hut. Cob, a mixture of clay, sand, and straw, is the perfect all natural material for your tiny home. Not only is it cheap, but it is also durable. Many homeowners assume that natural materials will deteriorate over time, but if you take the right measures in your tiny home design, you can have a home that will last for a lifetime. There are known cob structures in England that have been standing for 500 years. The key is to have an overhang roof too keep too much direct moisture from your exterior walls. A strong stone foundation will also help keep the bottom of your walls dry and safe from the elements. Cob is definitely the material to use if you want a one of a kind tiny home.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="typesInfo2">
              <h3 class="typeInfoHead">Vardo Tiny Homes</h3>
              <p>It doesn’t get tinier than living in a small wagon. Vardo tiny homes take the classic British Romani wagons and fit them into their minimalist lifestyle. Traditionally, vardos were horse-drawn and ornate in design. They had intricate carvings with rich color schemes on their interiors and showcased the work of woodcrafters. Modern vardos are commonly towed behind vehicles. They keep their iconic design which features a bow top and large wheels on the outside of their frame. The rounded top maximizes the space by keeping the widest part of the wagon where the bed would most likely be placed. This design also helps to minimize the side effects of strong winds.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="typesInfo3">
              <h3 class="typeInfoHead">RVs</h3>
              <p>It can be said that RVs are the original tiny house. Their small living quarters have been used as campers and low budget housing long before microliving trends came to be. If you’re looking to downsize or you want to live simply, an RV is a standard option. They have the benefits of mobility and no construction. You can easily find a ready-made RV that is ready for you to move in. An RV is also a good test to see if you want to commit to tiny house living. One drawback to living in an RV year round is that it is reserved for mild weather and shouldn’t be used during cold winters unless you have made some serious renovations.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="typesInfo4">
              <h3 class="typeInfoHead">Trailer Homes</h3>
              <p>The name of this tiny home design is deceiving. While it may sound like the same thing as the previously mentioned RV, a trailer tiny home is very different. Trailer tiny homes are full tiny houses that have been constructed on a trailer that’s hitched to the back of a truck. This tiny home design is the most common and the first tiny home plan to gain a lot of media attention. You can either hire a contractor or DIY with a plan you purchase online or simply draw your own. The frames are usually made of timber for cost effectiveness. This particular design is usually chosen for its mobility. If you’re a homeowner that likes a change of scenery, this mobile tiny home is perfect for you.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="typesInfo5">
              <h3 class="typeInfoHead">Shipping Containers</h3>
              <p>Shipping containers are probably the most mainstream tiny house design. People are very familiar with shipping containers themselves giving the large structures an easier transition into residential construction. While most homeowners use the large steel boxes that people are familiar with, there is a wide variety of materials for shipping containers. You can have a large scale wood shipping container if you want to build your tiny home with more traditional materials. Because it’s original commercial uses, shipping containers are both hurricane and fireproof, making them a durable option for your home. They coming different sizes which makes them ideal for a wide range of projects.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="typesInfo6">
              <h3 class="typeInfoHead">Houseboats</h3>
              <p>Houseboats are essentially the RVs of the water. These tiny homes have an element of fantasy by allowing the residents to live on the water. While they’re aren’t mobile on land, you can easily move through a body of water if you want a change of scenery. The small space is perfect for those looking for a simple lifestyle in an unconventional setting. You can’t deny that a houseboat gives you a unique lifestyle.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="typesInfo7">
              <h3 class="typeInfoHead">Yurts</h3>
              <p>If you want to be truly connected to your surroundings, a yurt is the tiny home design for you. Yurts are the traditional round tents that Mongolian nomads lived in. They were made to be portable with a basic wooden frame and felt covering. The walls were usually constructed with wood or bamboo latticework for a stable frame. Modern yurts are made to be semi-permanent. Construction takes a few days and they are able to be moved with some work. Many yurt builders use traditional lattice work for walls that is then reinforced to ensure that your home is structurally sound. They keep their traditional round shape and perfect for those looking for a minimalist lifestyle.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="typesInfo8">
              <h3 class="typeInfoHead">A-Frame Cabins</h3>
              <p>A-Frame cabins have a defining geometric shape to their home design. They have a classic cabin design that is usually made up of all wood. The simplicity of the cabin is appealing to those looking for a tiny home getaway with rustic charm. The interesting slanted walls give your tiny home a unique architectural element. The steep slopes are perfect for supporting bedroom lofts, a common feature in tiny homes to maximize space. The exterior is characterized by a steep sloped roof with large overhangs. This creates a covered porch aesthetic for your classic cabin.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="typesInfo9">
              <h3 class="typeInfoHead">Bus Conversions</h3>
              <p>Living in a bus may seem like a crazy idea, but bus conversions have become popular DIY tiny home projects. When you think of a school bus, you don’t picture a spacious home. However, once you get the bus and take out the rows of seats, you’re left with a long home that has plenty of space for your home design! There are a few different sizes of buses, so you should decide what you want to include in your home before buying the bus. The widths will remain consistent, but the lengths have a wide range that goes up to 40’. Many people might associate an old school bus with retro and dated home décor. However, once you completely empty your bus, you have a blank canvas. A school bus allows plenty of natural light into your space, as the walls are lined with windows. For times when you want more privacy, you can add curtains.</p>

      <h1>COSTS</h1>
    </div>

    <div id="costs">
      <div id="costsContent">
        <div id="construction">
          <h3>Cost of construction</h3>
          <h4>Land</h4>
          <p>Adding the price of land to a tiny home cost shouldn't be unexpected, but it can be forgotten about if the house is on wheels and you plan to move it. Even if you get a free deal to place your home on your parents' or friend's property, you should factor in the possibility that you may eventually want to move it. When you do, you may have to pay rent for a lot or space on the property of your choice.</p>
          <h4>Zoning laws</h4>
          <p>The jurisdiction in charge of the land you want to put your tiny house on will likely have laws on zoning, land use, building, and other red-tape headaches. None of these are cheap.</p>
          <p>Zoning laws and building codes are meant to make sure a home is safe and in an area where homes are allowed. If your tiny house isn't approved by your municipality, a code enforcement proceeding could be started against you and you could be forced to remove your tiny home and pay a fine.</p>
          <p>while a tiny house built on a permanent foundation may have one set of zoning codes to follow, a tiny house on wheels that qualifies as a recreational vehicle will likely have others. An RV on wheels may only be allowed for temporary residential use, and it
            may be illegal to live in one unless it's parked at an RV or mobile home park. You'll need to check your local regulations so you understand the specific laws in your area.</p>
          <h4>Cost of being mobile</h4>
          <p>One appeal of a tiny home is that they're mobile, and can either be towed or put on a flatbed truck. If you're spending money to meet zoning laws and buy land, then being mobile may not be so cost-efficient. And unless you can safely tow your tiny house yourself with a truck big enough to haul it, you'll have to pay someone else to move it.</p>
          <p>To be legal to tow, a tiny home must meet certain road requirements; namely, it can't be bigger than 13 feet by 6 inches in height and 8 feet by 6 inches in width, according to regulations in the U.S. Even if you have a truck with a big enough engine to tow a tiny house of 15,000 pounds or more, you'll want to ensure you can hook up trailer brakes to the truck, that your truck has the proper transmission for towing, and that you have the skills required to tow it.</p>
          <p>These costs can vary, but Tiny House Giant Journey estimates the annual cost of towing their tiny house at $1,520. That includes gas, truck and trailer maintenance, truck insurance, campground fees, and propane.</p>
          <span>Total cost of building: <strong class="hmmm">$31,160</strong></span>
        </div>
        <div id="living">
          <h3>Cost monthly expenses</h3>
          <h4>UTILITIES</h4>
          <p>As I mentioned above, trash and water are included in my parking spot. Electricity is also included with my specific agreement, but I do have a few utilities that I pay for monthly: gas and internet.</p>
          <h4>Gas</h4>
          <p>I use a propane water heater and a propane stove top in my Tiny House. I fill my 15lb propane tank about every three months. It costs about $7 a month on average because I usually choose to refill the tanks at a gas station (rather than doing an exchange). I also have a 3-way refrigerator, which uses propane when I’m off-grid. Currently, I’m plugged into a hefty electrical outlet, so I’m running my fridge on electricity.</p>
          <p class="hmmm">Monthly Gas Cost: $7</p>
          <h4>Internet</h4>
          <p>I use a local internet provider for high-speed internet in my house. I have a router and modem, like a regular home. My bill is $55 a month. I do not have cable, as that would be extra. When I was traveling with my Tiny House, I had a large data plan with Verizon Wireless and tethered my iPhone to my computer. This was very expensive, and I always blew through my data. I was spending about $130 a month on my Verizon bill.</p>
          <p class="hmmm">Monthly Internet Cost: $55</p>
          <h4>HOME INSURANCE</h4>
          <p>I do have insurance on my Tiny House, and I’ve written an in-depth insurance article about my experience (good and bad) with different policies. My current policy allows for renters because, when I’m traveling, I do rent my Tiny House out (call 877-570-2267 or visit this website and book the “Journey” Tiny House).My insurance costs $878.80 a year, and I pay it in full. For the purpose of this article, I’ll divide it out to a monthly cost.</p>
          <p class="hmmm">Monthly Insurance Cost: $74</p>
          <h4>HOME MAINTENANCE</h4>
          <p>I’ll be honest with you, I haven’t experienced much home maintenance in the last two years. I repaired my water heater two winters ago when it broke due to user error. That cost me about $250. That same year, I replaced all four tires because I had traveled over 25,000 miles (for the monthly cost of towing a Tiny House, click here). I also replaced my electric space heater after it died on me, which cost about $50. Last year, I installed a winter skirt for around $100, and I purchased a few items specifically for winter living (click here to see my favorite winter appliances).I haven’t spent more than a few hundred dollars on maintenance since parking at Mt. Hood Tiny House Village last summer. So, let’s estimate my monthly maintenance cost to be $30, on the high end. Normally, it’s zero.</p>
          <p class="hmmm">Monthly Insurance Cost: $30</p>
